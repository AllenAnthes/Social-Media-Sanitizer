# UCMO Mules One - Campus to Corporate

 Going into the corporate life can be challenging for students. They rarely write resumes or consider what it takes to be marketable to employers. With social media permeating all aspects of our lives, it can be easy to forget that something posted in the heat of the moment can come back to haunt them. Even worse, it can be an overwhelming task to clean it up. However, with our Social Media Sanitizer, students can now identify and list unsavory posts at the press of a button. 
 
	Using our new Social Media Sanitizer, with a simple login and press of a button, users can obtain a list of possibly objectionable posts. Once the list is produced the user can edit or delete the social media. With commecial data sales of individual users search terms, socials posts and other data, this gives the user an idea of what the employer would see when using those services. After modifying their social media they can search again. They will be more confident in approaching a potential employer and that a social media search will not result in a negative image.
