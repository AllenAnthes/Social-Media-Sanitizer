# UCMO Mules One - Campus to Corporate

Going into the corporate life can be challenging for students that have never built resumes or considered what is 
takes to impress, from looking the part to having the correct mannerisms.  With social media permeating all aspects of 
our lives, it can be easy for us to forget privacy for the convenience that technology gives us.  Students don’t always 
take into account what they have posted on social media. Therefore, we believe that they should have the capability to 
sanitize their social media life and begin their corporate life with a fresh start.

 Our web app will help students organize and format a resume and have helpful links to supply them with the skills 
 needed to have a successful interview.  Additionally, with our new Social Media Sanitizer, we are able to sort through the user’s 
 Facebook and Twitter feeds to locate comments and posts that could possibly contain profanity or other 
 unprofessional language that could influence a company’s opinion.  At that point the user can simply click on any post they
 would like to edit or delete and it will be opened with the requisite site.
